        My name is Dustin Honeck and I am a web and software developer based out of Wisconsin. In 2016, I received a bachelor's degree in information systems and a minor in computer science from the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse. I have been working as an IT technician for the last 7 years at a local school district but I am transitioning my career to web and software development.

        I recently completed a MERN full stack developer bootcamp through the University of Wisconsin in May of this year. Please reach out if you are looking to hire a developer for your company or organization. Examples of my work can be found on my <a href='/#portfolio'>Portfolio</a> page or on my <a href='https://github.com/dhoneck'>GitHub</a> page.
