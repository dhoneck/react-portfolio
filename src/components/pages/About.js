      <p>
        My name is Dustin Honeck and I am a web and software developer based out of Wisconsin. In 2016, I received a bachelor's degree in information systems and a minor in computer science from the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse. I have been working as an IT technician for the last 7 years at a local school district but I am looking to transfer my career to web or software development.

        I recently completed a full stack developer bootcamp through the University of Wisconsin in May of this year. Please reach out if you are looking to hire a developer for your company or organization.
